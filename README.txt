# Android Introduction Tips
This is a list of resources and tips meant to be helpful for someone just beginning Android development.

# Start Here: [Android developer docs](http://developer.android.com/develop/index.html)

This is the introduction page on the official android development documentation. Long after you've finished the getting started guides, and introductions and such this page will remain one of your primary resources.

The search bar is in the upper right hand corner. Whenever you have a question like : 

What does {some method} do? 
What if anything does {some method} return to me? 
Do I need to pass {some method} any parameters for it to work?
What actions can {some object} do? 
How do I create {some object}?

You should check here first. Paste or type in the whatever object or method you want to learn about and follow the first few links that it returns.

# Android Studio Words of Wisdom
Android Studio is what's called an IDE or Integraded Development Environment. An IDE is a program used to build and code other programs. They generally contain tools help you build and run your program. It can be overwhelming if you've never used an IDE before. If this is you I would suggest closing or minimizing as many of the extra windows as possible until you are left with just the main text editor. Once you figure out which stuff is put into which windows you can decide to turn them back on for quicker access.

Android Studio is an amazing tool that is designed and built specifically to make it easier for you to develop Android applications. You will be using this tool to write all of your Java code, or XML resources like layouts. 

Here are a few things to consider and keep in mind:
- Leave the Startup Tips in Android Studio on. Make an effort to read them each time. Keep a "cheat sheet" of ones that you find handy.
- Use Intelesense (auto-complete) to explore what different methods you are able to use for any given object.
- If you have a compile error (red underline) try putting your cursor on it and pressing Alt-Enter. IDE will suggest things that may fix the problem.
- As you use Android Studio it will become clear that it is a pretty large and complex tool. When everything is working it will make your life 100x easier. However sometimes the complexity becomes too much and it will break. When this happens *DONT PANIC*. Try searching on Google or Stackoverflow for any error that it is showing you, or the symptoms of the problem if there is no visible error. Chances are some other Android developer has seen it too and posted online.


# [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com)

This website will help you solve more problems than you can even imagine. Stack Overflow is a question and answer website for programmers. People are posting questions on there all the time. Other people spend time answering questions they can. The community uses a voting system to make the best questions, and answers easiest to find.

Whenever you have a question like: 

I ran my program and it crashed! It printed {some error} on the screen or in nasty red text in my debugger output. What is wrong, and how do I fix it? *Bonus points:* What caused it?
Based on my code, I think {some thing} should behave this way. But it is actually doing {something different}.
Android Studio is showing {some error} and it won't let me open/run my app.

Come to [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) and search for "`[android]` {error, thing, or behavior}" Chances are very good you'll find a problem similar to yours, and an answer that a few people found useful.
